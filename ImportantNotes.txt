Put important notes here!

Every Python function returns a value; if the function ever executes a return statement, it will return that value, otherwise it will return None, the Python null value.

Reading the argument list from left to right, once you have a single named argument, the rest of the arguments must also be named.

Many Python ides use the docstring to provide context-sensitive documentation, so that when you type a function name, its docstring appears as a tooltip. This can be incredibly helpful, but it’s only as good as the docstrings you write.

sys.path.insert(0, new_path), you inserted a new directory as the first item of the sys.path list

Python uses carriage returns to separate statements and a colon and indentation to separate code blocks. c++ and Java use semicolons to separate statements and curly braces to separate code blocks.

In reality, exceptions are implemented as classes, and this raise statement is actually creating an instance of the ValueError class and passing the string 'number must be non-negative' to its initialization method.

Modules are objects, and all modules have a built-in attribute __name__. A module’s __name__ depends on how you’re using the module. If you import the module, then __name__ is the module’s filename, But you can also run the module directly as a standalone program, in which case __name__ will be a special default value, __main__.

Booleans are either True or False.
Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.
Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an html document.
Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.
Lists are ordered sequences of values.
Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values.
Sets are unordered bags of values.
Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs.

Due to some legacy issues left over from Python 2, booleans can be treated as numbers. True is 1; False is 0.

Python 2 had separate types for int and long. The int datatype was limited by sys.maxint, which varied by platform but was usually 232-1. Python 3 has just one integer type, which behaves mostly like the old long type from Python 2. 

Floating point numbers are accurate to 15 decimal places.

When integer-dividing negative numbers, the // operator rounds “up” to the nearest integer. Mathematically speaking, it’s rounding “down” since −6 is less than −5, but it could trip you up if you were expecting it to truncate to −5.

The math module has all the basic trigonometric functions, including sin(), cos(), tan(), and variants like asin().

All list methods
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	    Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	    Returns a copy of the list
count()	    Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	    Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	    Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	    Sorts the list

A tuple is an immutable list. A tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.

Tuples are faster than lists. If you’re defining a constant set of values and all you’re ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list.

To create a tuple of one item, you need a comma after the value. Without the comma, Python just assumes you have an extra pair of parentheses, which is harmless, but it doesn’t create a tuple.

To create an empty set, call set() with no arguments. variable = {} will create a dictionary.

None is the only null value. It has its own datatype (NoneType). You can assign None to any variable, but you can not create other NoneType objects. All variables whose value is None are equal to each other.

Very roughly speaking, the character encoding provides a mapping between the stuff you see on your screen and the stuff your computer actually stores in memory and on disk. 

The most common encoding for these languages is CP-1252, also called “windows-1252” because it is widely used on Microsoft Windows. 

Unicode is a system designed to represent every character from every language.

In Python 2, the default encodeing for .py files was ASCII. In Python 3, the default encoding is UTF-8.
