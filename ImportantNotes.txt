Put important notes here!

Every Python function returns a value; if the function ever executes a return statement, it will return that value, otherwise it will return None, the Python null value.

Reading the argument list from left to right, once you have a single named argument, the rest of the arguments must also be named.

Many Python ides use the docstring to provide context-sensitive documentation, so that when you type a function name, its docstring appears as a tooltip. This can be incredibly helpful, but it’s only as good as the docstrings you write.

sys.path.insert(0, new_path), you inserted a new directory as the first item of the sys.path list

Python uses carriage returns to separate statements and a colon and indentation to separate code blocks. c++ and Java use semicolons to separate statements and curly braces to separate code blocks.

In reality, exceptions are implemented as classes, and this raise statement is actually creating an instance of the ValueError class and passing the string 'number must be non-negative' to its initialization method.

Modules are objects, and all modules have a built-in attribute __name__. A module’s __name__ depends on how you’re using the module. If you import the module, then __name__ is the module’s filename, But you can also run the module directly as a standalone program, in which case __name__ will be a special default value, __main__.
